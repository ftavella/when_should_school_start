## ðŸ“Š When Should School Start?  
### Exploring the Impact of School Start Times on Sleep Through Circadian Rhythms Simulation

The [interactive dashboard](school_start_times.ipynb) in this repository models how school start times influence your sleep duration throughout the year, using simulations grounded in circadian biology. By adjusting key parameters like city and Daylight Saving Time (DST) observance, you can visualize how environmental light cues and school schedules impact your sleep.

### What You Can Do:
- **Select a City**: Choose any city to see local sunrise/sunset patterns and simulate their effects on student sleep.
- **Toggle DST**: Explore scenarios with or without Daylight Saving Time to understand how it impacts wake-up times and sleep duration.
- **Run Simulations Year-Round**: Observe how sleep patterns change throughout the calendar year and identify optimal start times that align with healthy sleep.
